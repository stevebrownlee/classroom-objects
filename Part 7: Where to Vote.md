## Practice: Voting Booth Volunteers

In this exercise, you are going to access some nested object properties, and practice adding properties. Then you will use string interpolation to display the location 


```js
{
	title: "Commonwealth Community Center",
	address: {
		street: {
			number: 70,
			name: "Main Street"
		},
		city: "Nashville",
		state: "TN",
		zipCode: "37021"
	}
}
```
