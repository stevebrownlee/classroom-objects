## Practice: Voting Booth Volunteers

In this exercise, you are going to access some nested object properties, and practice adding properties. Then you will use string interpolation to display the name, location, and manager of a voting booth location.

### Step 1

In the starter code provided, add a new property to the booth object after it is created. Do not modify the original object. 

* Property name should be `manager`
* Property value should be "Abigail Brown"

### Step 2

Use string interpolation


```js
{
	name: "Commonwealth Community Center",
	address: {
		street: {
			number: 70,
			name: "Main Street"
		},
		city: "Nashville",
		state: "TN",
		zipCode: "37021"
	}
}
```
