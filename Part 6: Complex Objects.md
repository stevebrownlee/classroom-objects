## Adding New Properties After Creation

Just because you create an object that has 4 properties on it, it doesn't mean that the object will always have 4 properties on it. You can create more properties on it any time you wish. You just need to use dot `.` notation and assign a value. 

Here's an example where a flute object is initially created with no owner, but after it is purchased, an owner is added.

```js
const flute = {
	material: "Steel",
	length: 15,
	manufacturer: "Bloomgarden",
	price: 56.39
}
```
