## Libraries and Books

In this exercise, you are going to practice accessing properties on nested objects again. Remember that for each nested object, you need to use the dot `.` character to access it.

```js
const flower = {
	color: "Yellow",
	species: {
		name: "Tulip",
		rare: false,
		idealCondition: {
			shade: false,
			dailyWater: true,
			clay: false,
			soil: true
		}
	},
	price: 1.29,
	
```
