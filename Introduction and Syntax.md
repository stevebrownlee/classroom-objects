## Representing Life as Objects

Software developers are paid to represent real-world things and processes in code. To represent things like people, tools, animals, flowers, businesses, and financial transactions, we use objects.

You can identify an object in JavaScript by a series of properties surround by curly braces `{` and `}`. Here's a simple object that represents this chapter.

```js
const objectsIntro = {
	site: "repl.it",
	classroom: "Objects",
	chapter: "Introduction and Syntax",
	audience: "Beginners",
	minutesToComplete: 4.25
}
```

A property on an object is comprised of a key and a value. You can think of them just like declaring a variable, but the syntax is slightly different, and the variable is now grouped together with other ones in the context of the object.

```js
// Variable declaration

```
