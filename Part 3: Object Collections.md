Introduction to array of objects

## Object Collections

If previous work in the Foundations Course, you learned how to store a collection of related data in an array and how to use iteration to do something with everything in the array.

```js
const names = ["Jameka", "Rose", "Martin", "Greg", "Mary"]
const team = ""

for (const name of names) {
	team += `${name} `
}
```
